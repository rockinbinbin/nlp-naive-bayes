It all started when he decided there must be more to life than selling plants and motor spares, and set off to seek his fortune in Australia with 100 in his pocket. After selling security equipment there for a while, he went to New Zealand, and there made his first bungee dive off a high bridge. From there, he became involved with the first commercial bungee jumping company, and brought the idea back home. At the moment he holds bungee jumping days in Manchester, Birmingham, and the Lake District, with up to 100 people a day diving headlong off a 170ft  <head>crane</head>  on the end of a 30ft elasticated rope which stretches to 150ft.

SOLDIERS gave a devastating display of military muscle when they were called in to recover a truck dumped in a river. Civilian breakdown organisations more used to recovering cars from the nearby A66 broke out in a sweat when businessman David Gresty told them where his truck had been ditched. In desperation Mr Gresty turned to soldiers at nearby Catterick Garrison who agreed to recover the truck stuck in the River Skerne, on the outskirts of Darlington. Corporal Philip Ainsworth and Lance Corporal Andrew Zolden turned up in a 27-tonne Foden six-wheeler capable of hauling a light battle tank with its remote-control  <head>crane</head> .

While recognising that these were a strong portfolio of major brands, we acknowledged that the business had moved away from TISL's core development area.  <head>crane</head>  company doubles its size with Lilley buy By Peter Woodifield BUSINESS EDITOR WELDEX International Offshore, Scotland's leading crawler-crane hire company, has more than doubled in size after buying Piper Plant (Scotland), a subsidiary of the collapsed Lilley group. Weldex paid Price Waterhouse, the receiver, nearly 1 million for the business, which had a turnover of 5 million last year. Doug McGilvray, Weldex's managing director, said that at a stroke, the move had removed its biggest competitor in Scotland and doubled its own crane-hire fleet. In terms of general plant, Piper was bigger than us, while we were larger than them as crane operators, he said.

On completion of the project, the facility will be used to handle a new Liverpool-Dublin freight container service. Cargo discharged from the vessel Ruth-W was the first handled by the new CCL terminal. The facility expands the shipping line's operations because Coastal, bought by the MDHC in the summer of 1991, already has a Belfast terminal for its successful daily lift-on lift-off container service to Liverpool. On completion of a  <head>crane</head>  refurbishment programme and the modification of lifting facilities, Coastal now plans to inaugurate a Dublin-Liverpool container service before the end of the year.

ANOTHER example of the investment in Courtaulds Chemicals' Buckhaven site in Scotland is pictured being hoisted into position. The vessel, affectionately known as a scrubber, is a reactor that ensures no gas by-products from chemical processes are vented to the atmosphere. The large capacity of the reactor means gases can be scrubbed more quickly, removing a bottleneck and allowing the production process to operate more quickly. Installation involved hoisting the reactor by  <head>crane</head>  and gently lowering it into a prefabricated steel structure.

The Port Royal was not available until the end of March so we were asked to mobilise the Safe Holmia and another flotel the Polyconfidence first. This initial mobilisation was carried out at the beginning of March with all staff receiving company induction, full food hygiene training and safety induction and familiarisation on board the two installations. Then at the end of March we had to repeat the process, transferring all personnel equipment, housekeeping supplies and food from the Polyconfidence to the Port Royal. Equipment and supplies had to be packed into containers and transferred by  <head>crane</head> .
