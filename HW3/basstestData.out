And could they talk! With a brass section that cheerfully joined in any chorus they could remember complete with formation instrument swaying and excellent drums, double  <head>bass</head>  and guitar, it was easy to see that this band have been all over the world together.

Middlesbrough Town Hall RIDE grew up a lot in public in 1990 a year when bands like themselves and the Charlatans made it very big, very quickly. The floppy fringes and pouting lips of the respective lead singers are another story entirely. Ride do not seem to have developed very much since then, just quietly maturing into a dependable guitar band. Certainly, few of their contemporaries can get the range and quality of tunes from the classic  <head>bass</head> , guitars and drums line-up.

From the opening numbers, Stan Barker's BOB Blues and a roaring version of Broadway, the two leaders were at the top of their form. Their careers together go back to the 1960s with Alex Welsh with a later spell with with Humphrey Lyttelton and they obviously relished the chance to play together again. They've also completed a 15 day tour of the North with the Stan Barker Trio and had honed up playing together. For this one date they were supported by the Billy Harper Trio with Peter Stuart and Adrian Tilbrook on  <head>bass</head>  and drums and they fitted in as if they'd all been on tour together.

It was an unusual and intriguing evening. Tommy Chase Quartet Arts Centre, Darlington IT'S BEEN three years since the Tommy Chase Quartet last played in Darlington and in that time the other players have changed completely.

For this tour the final line-up had Dave Lewis on saxes, Les Miller double  <head>bass</head> , and guitarist Chris Watson who replaced the previously announced Hammond organist.
