Similarly, in Aldridge v. Johnson (1857 Q.B.) where the buyer supplied bags for the seller to put the goods (barley) into, it was held that property passed when the seller filled the bags. An easy and neat example of assent can also be found in the case of a purchase of petrol at a garage. If a petrol pump attendant puts the petrol into the customer's car, that is an unconditional appropriation to which the buyer's assent is clearly implied, Edwards v. Ddin (1976 D.C.). At a self-service garage it is the motorist who unconditionally appropriates the petrol by pouring it into his  <head>tank</head> , the assent of the seller being equally clearly implied. Thus at a self-service station, as in the case of a non self-service one, property in the petrol passes to the buyer when it is poured into his tank, R. v. McHugh (1977 D.C.).

To this end he proposed that representatives from the two states hold top-level talks on dismantling the barriers within the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which had divided the Korean peninsula since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The South's initial response was to question the sincerity of Kim's initiative and to dispute the existence of the concrete wall to which Kim had referred in his speech as the symbol of national division.

Violent clashes between these white residents and the police reportedly resulted in injuries to nearly 100 people, including 16 police. The Quebec government ordered the Army to dismantle the barricades on Aug. 27, having refused to accede to the Mohawks' additional demands that they be treated as a sovereign nation during negotiations and be granted immunity from prosecution.

Increased spending was requested for major strategic weapons systems, including increases of 2,900 million for SSN-21 nuclear powered submarines, 1,600 million for the previously beleaguered anti-missile Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), and 4,800 million for four more B-2 stealth bombers. The last two projects were expected to meet stiff congressional resistance. In addition the navy was to receive a new aircraft carrier and the army and air force would get the LH helicopter and an advanced tactical fighter aircraft, among a new generation of high technology systems expected to be partly financed by the termination of many existing systems.

United States President Bush said on June 1 that an agreement in principle on Soviet compliance with the November 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty cleared the way for an important step towards a super-power summit. Earlier that day, US Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh had met for talks in Lisbon, focusing on Soviet requests for economic assistance see p. 38272, on prospects for a Middle East peace conference and on the CFE issue. Neither Baker nor Bessmertnykh elaborated on how their CFE agreement was reached, but Baker stressed later that it respected the full integrity and credibility of the treaty. The US side had hitherto accused the Soviet military of evading the impact of CFE force reductions, in particular by transferring  <head>tank</head>  units east of the Urals (i.e. simply removing them from the area covered by the treaty, rather than destroying them see pp. 38027; 38122; 38217).

As the east European member states of the former Warsaw Pact and Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA, or Comecon) continued to experience severe economic difficulties in their transition to free-market systems, concerns were expressed during January and February at a series of incidents in which arms manufactured by those countries were supplied to Middle Eastern countries, apparently in contravention of the existing multilateral arms control provisions. German officials reported on Jan. 29 that a German freighter, the Godewind, bound from Szczecin in Poland for Syria, had been found to be carrying 16 Czechoslovak-made T-72 tanks for the Syrian armed forces, apparently in contravention of the Czechoslovak government's promise to end such transactions. The vessel was intercepted in the Mediterranean by the German navy and escorted to the German port of Kiel where its cargo was impounded. The incident aroused official protests from both Syria and Czechoslovakia, which claimed that the  <head>tank</head>  shipment formed part of a 252-tank deal approved by the Czechoslovakian authorities before the 1991 constraint agreement came into force. It was further reported on Feb. 2 that another 12 T-72 tanks had been loaded on a Danish freighter, the Nadia J, bound from Szczecin for Syria; it ran aground near the Danish port of Saeby and the tanks were seized by the Danish authorities, together with 46 tonnes of ammunition, on Feb. 3, giving rise to further protests from Syria. There were also persistent reports that Czechoslovak arms manufacturers were selling weapons to the Yugoslav federal forces, in contravention of UN policy. A Prague-based magazine, Respekt, reported in January that Yugoslavia was the intended recipient of some US1,500 million-worth of guns, rifles and anti-tank missiles ostensibly being sold to Nigeria.
