Packers anxious reassurance that they are all  portraits (relieving us of the potentially dangerous task of distinguishing those that are not) requires him to identify and locate a sitter or sitters. The evident difficulty of writing about an artist who has transformed the traditional process of mapping a terrain of physiognomical likeness onto the production of a surface that suggests a process of physical disintegration rendered in assertively material terms is resolved by Packer in an oblique but entirely conventional manner. The artist as subject is involved as authority for the authenticity of the subject as sitter and hence also for the legitimacy of the object as portrait. The artist's intimacy with a handful (the possessive act of holding in one's  <head>palm</head> ) of familiar sitters, fixed and therefore by implication immoveable both in the sense that they pose like good models and in the sense that they do not leave, travel or change and therefore have no narratives of their own.

They disappear for days, until their prey is peacefully relaxed, and then they leap, a killing frenzy of teeth: Why haven't you done this, where is that, why are you drinking coffee when you should be working, when will the design be ready, where are the back-up calculations? Pure scientists always have difficulty getting funding in harsh economic times. I suggest that one solution for biologists will be to apply their expertise to the new science of socioecology, and the environment of the office. There will be plenty of money available from rich companies, just as soon as socioecology becomes as well-established as graphology and  <head>palm</head> -reading.

The perfect world they sought lay in the individual and not in any dream of an idyllic country life. In the first stanza of The Garden Marvell rejects the outer world of human activities for inner world of peace and retirement in a sanctified garden.

He immediately cuts himself off from those ambitious city men who try to win the  <head>palm</head> , the oak, or bays, emblematic of the rewards given for artistic, political and military achievement.

Unemployment, however, was expected to fall from 8.1 per cent in 1988 to 7.9 per cent in 1989 due mainly to increased job opportunities in the manufacturing sector, whose contribution to GDP was estimated to have expanded from 24.4 per cent in 1988 to 25.6 per cent in 1989. Manufacturing output increased by 15.5 per cent in 1988, while manufacturing growth was estimated at 13 per cent for 1989. Agriculture continued to provide a large share of GDP: its contribution in 1989 was estimated to be 20.2 per cent, an increase of 3.1 per cent. Nevertheless, agricultural output showed signs of deceleration due to a steady decline in the international commodity prices of rubber, cocoa and especially  <head>palm</head>  oil which was the subject of a vigorous campaign in the United States to raise public awareness of the relationship between consumption of saturated fats and heart disease.

However, not all futures contracts are settled by the delivery of a cash market good; some are settled for cash. So far, we have discussed futures contracts in general terms and have referred to contracts being defined in terms of goods. It is certainly true that most futures contracts deal with commodities (e.g. aluminium, barley, cattle, citrus, cocoa, coffee, copper, corn, cotton, crude oil, gasoline, gold, heating oil, hogs, lead, lumber, nickel, oats, palladium,  <head>palm</head>  oil, plywood, pork bellies, potatoes, propane, rapeseed, rice, rubber, rye, silver, soybeans, sugar, tin, wheat, wool and zinc).

Automatically she looked around, too. And there, over the tops of the trees that grew on falling ground to their north, there on the other side of the valley was one of the liveliest country houses she had ever seen. As big as a cathedral it stood, in red Midland brick and warm Oxford limestone, with the noon sun full upon it. The woodland, marching up the hill, vanished before it but reached an arm around to the west, fringing the road, and then ran behind it to the north, forming a long backdrop to the  <head>palm</head>  house and the terraces. Only the clock tower on the stables showed from behind the trees.

Towards A.D. 900 refugees coming north from Moslem-occupied Spain settled near Len and established in that area an architectural style part Christian and part Arabic, called Mozarabic. The buildings were based upon late Roman designs but also displayed Oriental features especially in decoration and their use of brickwork in constructional and ornamental forms. A very good example here is the Church of S. Miguel de la Escalada, built as part of a monastery in 91213. This basilica, overlooking the river Esla, is 70 feet long and has a five bay nave separated from the aisles by marble columns with mixed capitals  Roman, Visigothic and tenth century Mozarabic (these last-named are  <head>palm</head>  leaf designs as in the Cordovan Mosque).
