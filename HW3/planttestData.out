So early oxygen levels would have been periodically depressed, in order to allow the first photosynthesizers to carry on evolving. Nevertheless vegetation soon started to proliferate  because liverworts, mosses, ferns, coniferous plants and flowers appeared in quick succession, introducing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in ever-increasing quantities. This was achieved through photosynthesis: plants were    able, by converting sunlight into energy, to live solely on sunshine, air and water, combined with other simple elements gleaned from the soil. They produce oxygen as a waste product, a normally lethal poison to the  <head>plant</head>  cell.

Although Stevie and I had known each other for a while we had never been romantically involved. Then somehow we did get romantically linked up and some people, right near the end of the situation with that band, singled us out as potentially more interesting than the band, which I suppose was a cruel situation really. By this time I had already been fooling around with sound on sound recording, and then in 1971 some aunt that I never even knew left a small house to me and my two brothers. The house was sold off and I ended up inheriting 12,000 dollars, so I went straight out and bought an AG 440 Ampex professional four track machine and took it up to my father's coffee  <head>plant</head> , and every night when he left I would drive up and work on Stevie's and my songs.

History is the study of the past using documents and inscriptions as evidence, and historians have recorded and interpreted events from the earliest days of writing up to the present day. Archaeology, on the other hand, is the study of the past using objects and other excavated evidence as the main source of data.

Almost anything can be used to shed light on the past: the foundations of buildings can show what sort of houses people lived in; the remains of tools show how they worked; animal bones and  <head>plant</head>  remains show what they ate; and pollen, snail shells and the remains of trees and plants can indicate the type of climate and vegetation at the time.

So generous is this bequest by birds to their young that a chick needs no additional food from which to build the flesh and bones and feathers of its infant body, and it still has enough energy left over to break its way out of the shell.

A butterfly sticks them on the leaves of the particular  <head>plant</head>  that her caterpillars eat; a blowfly on the dead flesh that her maggots will relish; and some wasps, for the sake of their young, become bodysnatchers.

The most diligent student of the region's past will find it extremely difficult to fix upon any period in earlier times in which the condition of the people can be seen as more attractive than the point reached by the early 1960s.

The transition from the post-war boom in traditional industries to a modernized branch  <head>plant</head>  structure occurred after the Hailsham Plan of 1963 and changed the nature of the origins of the region's economic problems from overspecialization by industrial sector (i.e. over-reliance on old basic industries particularly affected by changing market demands and the new international division of labour) into overspecialization by corporate function (i.e. under-representation of control and research and development functions).
