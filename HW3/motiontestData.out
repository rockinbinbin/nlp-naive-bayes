The bacteria have, embedded in their cell membranes, receptor molecules  that is, proteins whose molecular architecture enables them to recognize the glucose molecules  and tiny whip-like projections (flagella) which, by beating in unison, can row the bacteria up the glucose gradient. Mutants which lack the glucose receptors fail to show such behaviour, even though they will continue to make use of the glucose as an energy source if placed directly in contact with it. More complex single-celled animals, such as paramoecium, have similar projections, called cilia, connected at their bases by a system of fine threads, which enable the beat of the cilia to be coordinated. Except when it is actually feeding (it eats bacteria), the paramoecium is in constant  <head>motion</head> , frequently bumping into obstacles in its path and, when it does so, reversing by switching the beat of the cilia on one side.

1. There is a debate about discrepancies between the writings of Marx as a young man and his later output.

Andrea used her skills to create a performance piece, Trapeze, in which randomly edited and visually degraded news footage is projected over her suspended body. Entirely encased in a latex bodysuit she becomes anonymous, even androgynous. Hanging limp as a corpse, or straining to hold complex, delicately balanced poses, the elation of her soaring figure is juxtaposed with the very real pain and physical distress incurred. The contorted postures provide an eloquent visual commentary to the simultaneously projected real life imagery; her video and installation work include fragile, barely existing images (negative or miniature projections) of swinging figures, or herself freefalling from a 200 foot crane, continually repeated, as if caught in a time-loop of seemingly endless  <head>motion</head> .

For most of the time he combined this with the very important post of deputy treasurer-at-wars.

Ronald M Birse , Matthew  (17531781), engineer and inventor, was born at 3 Narrow Wine Street, Bristol, where he was baptized 18 November 1753, the son of Mary and William Wasbrough, originally a barber-surgeon and peruke maker, who was in partnership with Roger Rice in a brass-founding and clock-making business in Narrow Wine Street. He had at least three older brothers. Taking an early interest in his father's work, he constructed a steam engine with which to drive all the lathes and other machines; in order to do this, he had to convert the reciprocating movement of the Newcomen-type beam engine into rotary  <head>motion</head> . He achieved this by using a ratchet-and-pawl mechanism to produce the rotary motion, combined with a flywheel which reduced the otherwise excessive variations in the speed of rotation. On 10 March 1779 Wasbrough was granted a patent (no. 1,213) for a machine, which when applied to a steam-engine or any perpendicular motion will cause such movement to become circular, without the medium of a water-wheel, for grinding wheat and other grain, and for grinding, rolling, hammering, and other uses in mechanical operations. The ratchet-and-pawl device was quite effective in principle, but not robust or reliable enough in constant use, and it seems that, after he completed an engine to drive a mill owned by James Pickard at Snow Hill in Birmingham, it was found to be unsatisfactory, and a crank was substituted. It is not known who suggested this alteration, but anyhow the problem was solved; in the words of John Farey q.v.: The engine then answered so much better than anything which had been tried before that the same principle has been followed ever since. This was probably the first successful application of the crank to a steam engine in order to produce rotary motion. A patent (no. 1,263) was granted to Pickard on 23 August 1780 for a new-invented method of applying steam engines to the turning of wheeles, whereby a rotative motion is performed, and the power of the engine is more immediately and fully applied than by the intervention of water.

Alford made his name as a vigorous and informed opponent of impositions, monopolies, proclamations, and purveyance, and was an inveterate foe of Chancery. Already in 1610 he was one of a select number of the Lower House who met with the lord treasurer, Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury q.v., son of his father's patron, to discuss impositions. He was always reluctant to approve subsidies; in 1621, when other members were prepared to pledge their lives and fortunes to recover the Palatinate, he observed bitterly that the farmers would say, if you will have three taxes in one year, we must have three harvests in one year. Such rhetoric was backed by a proper concern for the freedom and order of the House, down to such details as a successful  <head>motion</head>  (16 December 1606) that the adjournment of a committee on a bill should be announced in the House.

Maximum ozone concentration occurs at a height of 1618 km in polar latitudes and at about 25 km over the equator. This ozone layer is important to society and the environment for two reasons. Firstly, the ozone absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation in the UV-B or 280320 nm wavelengths, thus warming the stratosphere and producing a steep temperature inversion between 15 and 50 km. As temperature decreases with height in the troposphere (reaching -40 to -80 C at the tropopause), the effect of a warm stratosphere is to act as a ceiling or lid to vertical  <head>motion</head>  in the troposphere  that is, convective processes which produce clouds and precipitation are contained within the troposphere.
